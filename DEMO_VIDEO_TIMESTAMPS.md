Tired of Googling shell commands? Meet Haunted Terminal. Just tell it what you want in plain English, and watch the magic happen. We launch Haunted Terminal. It connects to Ollama, a local AI running entirely on your machine. No internet, no API keys, no sending your commands to Google like Gemini CLI does. Everything stays private. Your secrets are safe with the spirits.

*VIDEO: Show frustrated developer Googling commands → Haunted Terminal logo appears with mystical effect → Type `haunted` → Welcome screen with ghost emoji and "offline mode" → Quick comparison: Haunted (local ghost) vs Gemini (cloud with X)*

Let's try it. I type: show me all files. Boom. It suggests the command before running anything. I confirm, and there they are. Now something trickier. I type: show me all Python files I edited this week. The system understands time-based searches and nails the syntax. Notice how it combines filters perfectly. This isn't guesswork, it's trained on comprehensive examples. Unlike Gemini CLI that might hallucinate commands, Haunted Terminal gets it right.

*VIDEO: Type "show me all files" → Quick loading with ghost animation → Command appears → Press enter → Files appear → Type "show me all python files I edited this week" → Show correct command with highlighting → Execute → Show results → Quick "vs Gemini CLI" comparison showing wrong command*

**1:06 - 1:40 | Section 3 (565 chars)**
What if I don't like the command? Just type: retry. It generates something completely different, learning from what I rejected. With Gemini CLI, you'd retype everything and pray. Here, the spirits remember. The system also protects you. I type: delete all files. Red alert. It recognizes destruction and demands confirmation. I can say yes, no, or retry. No more accidental disasters because you weren't paying attention.

*VIDEO: Show mediocre command → Type "retry" with ghost swirl effect → New better command appears → Split screen: Gemini (retyping) vs Haunted (just "retry") → Type "delete all files" → Dramatic red warning with skull emoji → Show yes/no/retry options → Type "no" → Phew, saved*

**1:41 - 2:20 | Section 4 (625 chars)**
Quick showcase. I type: search for error in logs. Perfect grep command. I type: find Python processes. Pipes to grep instantly. I type: open Chrome. Launches immediately. The system has memory. It learns your patterns. You can create rituals for complex workflows. Type: perform deploy. It runs your tests, builds, and pushes in sequence. Visual feedback for each step. If something fails, you choose whether to continue. This is workflow automation made simple.

*VIDEO: Rapid-fire montage: "search for error" → Execute → "find python processes" → Execute → "open chrome" → Chrome pops up → Type "history" → Show learned patterns → Type "ritual" → Show ritual list → Type "perform deploy" → Show steps executing with progress bars and checkmarks → Success celebration*

Let's talk about why this destroys Gemini CLI. First, privacy. Everything runs locally on your machine. Your commands never touch Google's servers. No data collection, no tracking, no sending your company secrets to the cloud. Gemini CLI? Every command goes through Google. Second, speed. No network latency, no API rate limits. Instant responses every time. Third, accuracy. Gemini CLI hallucinates commands that don't exist. Haunted Terminal is trained on real examples and gets it right. Fourth, features. We have rituals for workflows, memory that learns your patterns, safety checks, and a knowledge base. Gemini CLI? Just basic command generation. Fifth, cost. Completely free forever. No subscriptions, no usage limits. Gemini CLI charges you per request. The interface is gorgeous too. Dark theme, color-coded feedback, smooth animations. The spirits whisper suggestions as you type. Stop memorizing commands. Start speaking to your terminal. Haunted Terminal. Where natural language meets the command line.

*VIDEO: Show dramatic comparison split screen throughout → Privacy: Haunted (local lock icon) vs Gemini (cloud with data flowing to Google) → Speed: Haunted (instant) vs Gemini (loading spinner) → Accuracy: Haunted (correct command) vs Gemini (error/hallucination) → Features: Show Haunted's rituals, memory, safety vs Gemini's basic interface → Cost: Haunted (FREE) vs Gemini ($ $ $) → Show beautiful interface with colors → Show spirit suggestions → Quick montage → Fade to logo with ghost → "github.com/yourusername/haunted-terminal" → End with ghost wink and "100% Free. 100% Private. 100% Local."*
